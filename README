This is a simple python script that I use to take exports of music files
from my iTunes library and make the usable via the SD reader on my
VW Jetta/Mercedes.  I don't think either device supports the apple lossless
codec, so this converts them to MP3.  It also uses the tags in the files
to determine the name/track number/etc and use the data to name the files
and organize the files into directories.
